# NotSoEssentials
Essentials but much, much worse

NotSoEssentials is a much, much worse version of EssentialsX i decided to make once i realized i had no ideas on what to make a plugin on.

It was made using a cool little plugin maker i found called Visual Bucket that makes plugin making really easy and you dont need to code at all.
